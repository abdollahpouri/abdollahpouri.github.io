 I am a Research Scientist at Spotify Research in New York City, working on personalization and recommendation algorithms. 
Prior to Spotify, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Spiegel Research Center at Northwestern University working on personalization and 
recommender systems for media and news. I obtained my Ph.D. in Information & Computer Science at the University of Colorado Boulder in 2020
under the supervision of Prof. Robin Burke. I am experienced in state-of-the-art research in recommender systems and personalization.
In particular, I am known for my work on popularity bias in recommender systems and for developing algorithms to tackle such bias from the
perspective of multiple stakeholders. My research in popularity bias and multi-stakeholder recommender systems has garnered more than 1600
citations since 2017, indicating the influence of my work in the research community. In addition to being active in the research community,
I also have experience in end-to-end large-scale Machine Learning in the industry.


<!-- <p align="justify">
	Before joining Spotify, I was at Netflix, first driving causal recommendation initiatives 
	and subsequently building and leading the Adaptive Experimentation team, which was a 
	cross-functional team of researchers, engineers and data scientists focused on delivering 
	new experimentation capabilities at Netflix (adaptive bandit-based online tests instead of 
	A/B tests; valid inference from adaptive online tests; ML-based short-term proxy metrics of 
	long-term online metrics etc.). Prior to Netflix, I did a PhD on reinforcement learning and 
	causal inference at Stanford where I was advised by Benjamin Van Roy and Susan Athey and I 
	worked at Google Research on the design and deployment of large-scale optimization algorithms 
	for Google Technical Infrastructure and Google Ad Exchange.  -->

<header><h4>Calibrated Recommendations as a Minimum-Cost Flow Problem</h4></header>
<p><i>Himan&nbspAbdollahpouri, Zahra&nbspNazari, Alex&nbspGain, Clay&nbspGibson, Maria&nbspDimakopoulou, 
	Jesse&nbspAnderton, Benjamin&nbspCarterette, Mounia&nbspLalmas, Tony&nbspJebara (WSDM 2023)</I></p>
	<p>Calibration in recommender systems has recently gained significant attention. In the recommended
	list of items, calibration ensures that the various (past) areas of interest of a user are reflected
	with their corresponding proportions. For instance, if a user has watched, say, 80 romance movies and
	20 action movies, then it is reason-able to expect the recommended list of movies to be comprised of 
	about 80% romance and 20% action movies as well. Calibration is particularly important given that 
	optimizing towards accuracy often leads to the userâ€™s minority interests being dominated by their main
	interests, or by a few overall popular items, in the recommendations they receive. In this paper, we
	propose a novel approach based on the minimum-cost flow problem for generating calibrated recommendations. 
	In a series of experiments using two publicly available datasets, we demonstrate the superior 
	performance of our proposed approach compared to the state-of-the-art in generating relevant and 
	calibrated recommendation lists.
