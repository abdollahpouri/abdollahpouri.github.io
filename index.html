 I am a Research Scientist at Spotify Research in New York City, working on personalization and recommendation algorithms. 
Prior to Spotify, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Spiegel Research Center at Northwestern University working on personalization and 
recommender systems for media and news. I obtained my Ph.D. in Information & Computer Science at the University of Colorado Boulder in 2020
under the supervision of Prof. Robin Burke. I am experienced in state-of-the-art research in recommender systems and personalization.
In particular, I am known for my work on popularity bias in recommender systems and for developing algorithms to tackle such bias from the
perspective of multiple stakeholders. My research in popularity bias and multi-stakeholder recommender systems has garnered more than 1600
citations since 2017, indicating the influence of my work in the research community. In addition to being active in the research community,
I also have experience in end-to-end large-scale Machine Learning in the industry.

<header><h4>Calibrated Recommendations as a Minimum-Cost Flow Problem</h4></header>

	<p>Calibration in recommender systems has recently gained significant attention. In the recommended
	list of items, calibration ensures that the various (past) areas of interest of a user are reflected
	with their corresponding proportions. For instance, if a user has watched, say, 80 romance movies and
	20 action movies, then it is reason-able to expect the recommended list of movies to be comprised of 
	about 80% romance and 20% action movies as well. In this paper, we
	propose a novel approach based on the minimum-cost flow problem for generating calibrated recommendations. 
	We demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed approach compared to the state-of-the-art in generating relevant and 
	calibrated recommendation lists.

<header><h4>Multistakeholder Recommender Systems</h4></header>
<p><i>Himan&nbspAbdollahpouri and Robin&nbspBurke (Recommender Systems Handbook 2022)</I></p>
	<p> Multistakeholder recommendation is the term applied when a recommender system is designed, 
		implemented and/or evaluated taking into account the perspectives of multiple stakeholder groups.
		Published studies of recommender systems largely concentrate on optimizing only for user experience. 
		However, a user-centric approach does not account for system objectives such as fairness, balance, 
		and profitability, and obscures concerns that might come from other stakeholders, 
		such as the providers or sellers of items being recommended. This chapter describes the characteristics of
		multistakeholder recommendation and particular considerations involved in creating and evaluating multistakeholder 
		recommender systems, and demonstrates these ideas in a multistakeholder evaluation of existing algorithms.

<header><h4>A Graph-Based Approach for Mitigating Multi-Sided Exposure Bias in Recommender Systems</h4></header>

	<p> Fairness is a critical system-level objective in recommender systems that has been the subject of extensive
recent research. A specific form of fairness is supplier exposure fairness, where the objective is to ensure
equitable coverage of items across all suppliers in recommendations provided to users. In this article, we introduce FairMatch, a general graph-based algorithm that works as a post-processing
approach after recommendation generation to improve exposure fairness for items and suppliers. The algorithm iteratively adds high-quality items that have low visibility or items from suppliers with low exposure to
the usersâ€™ final recommendation lists. We show that FairMatch, although it significantly improves exposure fairness and
aggregate diversity, maintains an acceptable level of relevance of the recommendations.

<header><h4>User-centered Evaluation of Popularity Bias in Recommender Systems</h4></header>
<p><i>Himan&nbspAbdollahpouri, Masoud&nbspMansoury, Robin&nbspBurke, 
	Bamshad&nbspMobasher, Edward&nbspMalthouse (UMAP 2021)</I></p>
	<p> Recommendation and ranking systems are known to suffer from popularity bias. 
	Prior research has examined various approaches for mitigating popularity bias and enhancing the recommendation of long-tail, 
	less popular, items. The effectiveness of these approaches is often assessed using different metrics to evaluate the extent 
	to which over-concentration on popular items is reduced but not much attention is give to how different users with different levels of interest towards 
	popular items are affected by such algorithms. 
	In this paper, we show the limitations of the existing metrics to evaluate popularity bias mitigation and we propose new metrics that can address these limitations. 
	In addition, we present an effective approach that mitigates popularity bias from the user-centered point of view.
